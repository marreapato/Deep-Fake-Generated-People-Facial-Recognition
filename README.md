[Fake Person AI Face Identifier](https://deep-fake-generated-people-facial-recognition.streamlit.app/)

This web application is designed to distinguish between real faces and AI-generated ones using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model has been trained on a robust dataset of 140,000 images, ensuring accuracy and reliability.

## How to Use
1. **Upload**: Simply upload a picture of a person's face to the web app.
2. **Analyze**: Our AI will analyze the image, providing the probability of whether the face is real or fake.

## Branches
- **Main Branch**: Contains the training code for the AI model.
- **Streamlit-App Branch**: Houses the code for the Streamlit web application.

## Version 1.0.0
- Initial release featuring CNN model implementation and basic probability prediction.

## Future Updates üöÄ
We are committed to improving our model:
- Implementing transfer learning for enhanced accuracy.
- Utilizing more extensive training data for better performance.

## Important Note
This tool, when used in conjunction with human knowledge, aids in identifying AI-generated faces. Results may vary, and the model may not capture the effects of state-of-the-art models like StableDiffusion but performs well with samples from This Person Does Not Exist's website.

Feel free to contribute or provide feedback to make this tool even more powerful!
